# NdexEdit

Networks are crucial in biological research! But there is a natural void between desktop clients to create, edit and beautify a network, and web apps to distribute them: NDExEdit aims to fill that void. Try the [demo](https://frankkramer-lab.github.io/NDExEdit/) to see how web-based editing of a network could look like.

**First steps**

If you never worked with NDExEdit before, here are a few first steps you might want to try out:

- Visit the [NDExBIO](http://www.ndexbio.org/#/) Website and select a network you would like to edit visually
- Enter this network's URL or UUID into the downloader under "Manage" or select a local .cx file
- Inspect the information displayed to this specific network by clicking on the i-Icon right next to the networks name
- Click on "Edit" to manipulate how the graph is displayed
- You can download the adapted graph as .cx file
